# Ressette
HackGT9 Hackathon Project

Ressette is a revival of the classic cassette mixtape. While modern music players are convenient and shareable, sentimental value is lost when decoupling music from its physical medium. By tying a playlist to an NFC card, friends can share music in a way that is authentically retro, reset their perspective on how music can be listened to, and remember that community is at the heart of music.
